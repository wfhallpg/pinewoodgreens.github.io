In Pinewood Greens we are an association of neighbors. What we do is guided by an elected Board of Directors, a handful of committees, and an active contingent of volunteers who give their time to make our Association work.

#The Board of Directors

Nine people have been elected by the members to direct our Association. Our meetings are held monthly at the community center, 2731 Hyson Lane, Falls Church, Virginia 22043.

The board meetings are all listed on the [assocation calendar](https://www.google.com/calendar/hosted/pinewoodgreens.com/embed?src=pinewoodgreens.com_8dlgr29ukho8ps0v8dumvs4hq0%40group.calendar.google.com&amp;ctz=America/New_York)(at right)

Dates and times for Board meetings are also posted on the bulletin board at the front of the community center. Everyone is invited, so please come to our meetings. 

If you ever need to talk to one of the members of Board, call the Association office and one of us will call you back.

#The Association Committees

We hope you can join one of our committees:

- maintenance (takes care of the commons)
- architecture (ensures that our houses are maintained well)
- pool (in charge of summer fun)
- social (in charge of fun the rest of the year)
- communications (in charge of websites, the bark, and general communications of the association)

Dates and times for committee meetings are posted on association calendar and the bulletin board at the front of the community center.
